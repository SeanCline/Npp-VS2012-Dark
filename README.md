# VS2015 Dark Theme for Notepad++

- [Atom Version](https://github.com/Nidre/VS2015-Dark-Atom/)
- [Android Studio / IntelliJ Version](https://github.com/Nidre/VS2015-Dark-Android-Studio/)

This is as close as I can get to a replica of the Visual Studio 2015's Dark theme in Notepad++. I created it to ease switching between files opened in Visual Studio and Notepad++. Particularly close attention has been paid to C, C++, and XML but a number of other languages have been tested.

Installation
--------------------------

1. **Right Click** to [`VS2015-Dark.xml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nidre/VS2015-Dark-Npp/master/VS2015-Dark.xml) and select **Save As** to download the theme.
2. Go to **%APPDATA%\Notepad++**.
3. Open **themes** folder, create a new folder named **themes** if it doesn't exists.
4. Place downloaded **.xml** file inside the folder.
2. Restart Notepad++.
3. Open *Settings->Style Configurator*.
4. Select **VS2015-Dark** from the theme drop-down box.
5. Click **Save & Close**
